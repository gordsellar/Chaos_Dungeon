# Chaos_Dungeon
A dungeon generator for my pen-and-paper RPG sessions.

## The Plan
* Get the `Room()` class working with barebones.
    * Add `Feature()` class, which introduces generic room features.
    * Add `Creature()` class, a sub-class of the `Feature()` class.
    * Add `Treasure()` class, a sub-class of `Feature()` class.
    * Add `Trap()` class, a sub-class of the `Feature()` class.
    * Add `Door()` class, a sub-class of the `Feature()` class.
