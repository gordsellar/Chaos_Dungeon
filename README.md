# Chaos_Dungeon
A dungeon generator for my pen-and-paper RPG sessions.

## The Plan
* Get the `Room()` class working with barebones.
    * Add `Feature()` class, which introduces generic room features.
    * Add `Creature()` class, a sub-class of the `Feature()` class.
    * Add `Treasure()` class, a sub-class of `Feature()` class.
    * Add `Trap()` class, a sub-class of the `Feature()` class.
    * Add `Door()` class, a sub-class of the `Feature()` class

## Dependencies
The current dependencies to run Chaos_Dungeon is the following. If it can be installed with `pip` I will include a line to copy and paste, if not I will link to instructions for download (I doubt this will be the case though):
    * `console` (handy `pip` line: `pip install --upgrade console`)
